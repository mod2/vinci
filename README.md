Plugins come in two parts: a Python preprocessor (located in `plugins/[pluginname].py`) and a JavaScript postprocessor (located in `static/plugins/[pluginname]/[pluginname].js`). See examples.

To activate a plugin, add it to the `plugins` entry in `config.py`. Make sure you add any CSS/JS files the plugin needs to include.
